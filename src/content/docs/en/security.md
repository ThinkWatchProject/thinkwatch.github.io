# ThinkWatch Security Documentation

This document describes the security architecture, mechanisms, and hardening practices for ThinkWatch.

---

## 1. Authentication

ThinkWatch supports three authentication mechanisms. The gateway accepts any of them; the console management API requires JWT.

### 1.1 JWT Tokens

ThinkWatch issues two JWT tokens upon successful authentication:

| Token          | Default Lifetime | Purpose                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Access token   | 900s (15 min)    | Short-lived credential for API authorization |
| Refresh token  | 604800s (7 days) | Used to obtain new access/refresh token pair |

Both TTL values are configurable via the admin Web UI (`jwt_access_ttl_seconds` and `jwt_refresh_ttl_seconds` settings) without requiring a server restart.

**Signing algorithm:** HS256 with a shared secret (`JWT_SECRET` environment variable). A migration to RS256 with asymmetric key pairs is planned for a future release.

**Secret requirements:**
- `JWT_SECRET` must be at least 32 characters long.
- At startup, ThinkWatch performs an entropy check and rejects secrets that are trivially weak (e.g., all identical characters, common patterns).
- Generate a strong secret with: `openssl rand -hex 32`

**Clock skew tolerance:** A 30-second leeway is applied when validating token expiration (`exp`) and not-before (`nbf`) claims, accommodating minor clock differences between distributed services.

**Token claims:**

```json
{
  "sub": "user-uuid",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "admin",
  "exp": 1711930500,
  "iat": 1711929600,
  "iss": "thinkwatch"
}
```

**Refresh flow:** The client sends the refresh token to `POST /api/auth/refresh`. The server validates the token, issues a new access/refresh pair, and invalidates the old refresh token. Refresh token reuse is detected and causes all tokens for the user to be invalidated (rotation with replay detection).

### 1.2 API Keys

API keys provide long-lived authentication for programmatic access to the gateway.

| Property        | Detail                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Format          | Prefixed with `tw-` (e.g. `tw-sk-a1b2c3d4...`)  |
| Storage         | SHA-256 hash stored in PostgreSQL                |
| Validation      | Middleware hashes the incoming key and looks it up (filters `deleted_at IS NULL`) |
| Scoping         | Optional `allowed_models` restriction            |
| Rate limiting   | Optional per-key RPM limit, enforced via Redis   |
| Expiration      | Optional TTL set at creation time                |

The raw key value is returned exactly once at creation time. It cannot be retrieved afterward because only the hash is stored.

**Lifecycle management:**

API keys now support a full lifecycle with the following capabilities:

- **Rotation:** Keys can be rotated via `POST /api/keys/{id}/rotate`. A new key is generated and returned; the old key enters a configurable grace period during which both old and new keys are accepted. The `grace_period_ends_at` timestamp indicates when the old key will stop working.
- **Grace period:** After rotation, the API key auth middleware accepts both the old and new key hashes until `grace_period_ends_at` expires, allowing clients to transition without downtime.
- **Inactivity timeout:** Keys can be configured with an `inactivity_timeout_days` value. If a key is not used within that period, it is automatically disabled by the background lifecycle task.
- **Auto-disable:** Keys that exceed their inactivity timeout are soft-disabled (not deleted), allowing administrators to re-enable them if needed.
- **Expiry monitoring:** Use `GET /api/keys/expiring?days=N` to list keys approaching their expiration date.
- **Team validation:** API key creation validates team membership -- users can only create keys within teams they belong to.

### 1.3 OIDC / SSO

ThinkWatch supports OpenID Connect for single sign-on with enterprise identity providers (Entra ID, Okta, Keycloak, Auth0, etc.).

**Flow: Authorization Code**

1. The user's browser is directed to `GET /api/auth/sso/authorize`.
2. The server generates a cryptographically random `state` and `nonce`, stores both in Redis with a 10-minute TTL, and redirects the browser to the OIDC provider's authorization endpoint.
3. After authentication, the IdP redirects back to `GET /api/auth/sso/callback?code=...&state=...`.
4. The server validates the `state` against Redis (CSRF protection), exchanges the authorization code for tokens, verifies the ID token signature and `nonce`, and provisions or updates the local user record.
5. ThinkWatch JWT tokens are returned to the client.

**CSRF protection:** The `state` parameter is a one-time random value stored in Redis. It is consumed (deleted) on callback, preventing replay attacks.

### 1.4 Dual Authentication on Gateway

The gateway middleware attempts authentication in the following order:

1. If the `Authorization` header contains a token starting with `tw-`, validate it as an API key.
2. Otherwise, validate it as a JWT Bearer token.

This allows both programmatic clients (API keys) and browser-based/console users (JWT) to access the gateway seamlessly.

### 1.5 Session IP Binding

When a user logs in, the signing key is bound to their client IP address. On subsequent requests, the signature verification middleware checks that the request IP matches the IP stored at login time. If the IP differs, the request is rejected with 401 Unauthorized.

This prevents stolen signing keys from being used across different networks.

---

## 2. Authorization (RBAC)

ThinkWatch implements role-based access control with five system roles.

### 2.1 Role Hierarchy

| Role      | Description                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `admin`   | Full system access. Can manage providers, users, MCP servers, settings, and view audit logs. |
| `operator`| Can manage providers and MCP servers. Cannot manage users or system settings. |
| `user`    | Standard user. Can create/manage own API keys, view analytics, and use the gateway. |
| `viewer`  | Read-only access. Can view analytics and models but cannot create keys or modify anything. |
| `service` | Machine-to-machine identity. API key access to the gateway only; no console access. |

### 2.2 Access Control Matrix

| Resource                | admin | operator | user | viewer | service |
| ----------------------- | ----- | -------- | ---- | ------ | ------- |
| Gateway (chat, models)  | Yes   | Yes      | Yes  | Yes    | Yes     |
| Gateway (MCP)           | Yes   | Yes      | Yes  | Yes    | Yes     |
| Own API keys (CRUD)     | Yes   | Yes      | Yes  | No     | No      |
| Analytics (read)        | Yes   | Yes      | Yes  | Yes    | No      |
| Providers (CRUD)        | Yes   | Yes      | No   | No     | No      |
| MCP servers (CRUD)      | Yes   | Yes      | No   | No     | No      |
| Users (CRUD)            | Yes   | No       | No   | No     | No      |
| Audit logs              | Yes   | No       | No   | No     | No      |
| System settings         | Yes   | No       | No   | No     | No      |

### 2.3 Middleware Enforcement

- **`require_auth`** — Extracts and validates JWT from the `Authorization` header. Rejects unauthenticated requests with 401.
- **`require_admin`** — Chains after `require_auth`. Checks that the JWT `role` claim is `admin`. Rejects non-admin users with 403.
- **API key middleware** — Gateway-specific. Validates the API key hash, checks expiration, enforces `allowed_models`, and applies rate limiting via Redis.

### 2.4 MCP Tool-Level Access Control

MCP tools can be restricted at the API key or user level. When an API key has `allowed_models` set, MCP tool invocations are also gated: the gateway checks that the calling identity has permission to invoke the specific tool before proxying the request to the upstream MCP server.

---

## 3. Encryption

### 3.1 Encryption at Rest

**Provider API Keys**

Provider API keys (credentials for upstream AI services like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure OpenAI, and AWS Bedrock) are encrypted before storage:

- Algorithm: AES-256-GCM
- Nonce: 12 bytes, cryptographically random, generated per encryption operation
- Key: Derived from the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable (32-byte hex string)
- Storage format: `nonce || ciphertext || tag` (base64-encoded)

**AWS Bedrock Credentials**

AWS Bedrock credentials (stored in `ACCESS_KEY_ID:SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` format) are encrypted at rest using the same AES-256-GCM scheme. At request time, credentials are decrypted and used for AWS SigV4 request signing via the official `aws-sigv4` Rust crate. The signing process is performed in-memory and credentials are never written to disk in plaintext.

**MCP Server Auth Secrets**

Authentication credentials for upstream MCP servers use the same AES-256-GCM scheme as provider API keys.

### 3.2 Password Hashing

User passwords are hashed using Argon2id with the following parameters:

| Parameter       | Value       |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Algorithm       | Argon2id    |
| Memory cost     | 19 MiB      |
| Time cost       | 2 iterations|
| Parallelism     | 1           |
| Salt            | 16 bytes, random |
| Output hash     | 32 bytes    |

Argon2id is the recommended algorithm per OWASP guidelines, providing resistance against both GPU and side-channel attacks.

### 3.3 Password Complexity

All password-setting operations (registration, setup wizard, password change, admin user creation) enforce:
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- At least one digit (0-9)

### 3.4 API Key Hashing

API keys are hashed with SHA-256 before storage. This is a one-way operation; the original key cannot be derived from the hash. The raw key is returned to the user exactly once at creation time.

### 3.5 Encryption in Transit

ThinkWatch itself does not terminate TLS. TLS termination should be handled by a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, Traefik, cloud load balancer). See the hardening checklist in Section 6.

---

## 4. Network Security

### 4.1 Dual-Port Architecture

ThinkWatch separates concerns across two ports:

| Port | Server  | Exposure                               |
| ---- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 3000 | Gateway | Intended for application/client access |
| 3001 | Console | Intended for admin/internal access     |

This separation allows network-level isolation: the gateway port can be exposed to application traffic while the console port is restricted to a VPN or internal network.

### 4.2 CORS

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is configured via the `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable:

- Accepts a comma-separated list of allowed origins.
- Credentials are allowed (`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`).
- Only the specified origins are reflected in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.
- In development, `http://localhost:5173` (Vite dev server) is typically allowed.
- In production, restrict to your actual console domain.

### 4.3 Security Headers

The following headers are set on all responses:

| Header                    | Value              | Purpose                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `X-Content-Type-Options`  | `nosniff`          | Prevents MIME type sniffing               |
| `X-Frame-Options`         | `DENY`             | Prevents clickjacking via iframes         |

**Content Security Policy (console port only):**

The console port (3001) includes a `Content-Security-Policy` header to mitigate XSS and data injection attacks. The policy restricts script sources, style sources, and connection endpoints to known origins.

### 4.4 Request Timeouts

| Server  | Timeout | Rationale                                        |
| ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Gateway | 120s    | LLM completions (especially streaming) can be slow |
| Console | 30s     | Management operations should complete quickly    |

### 4.5 Container Security

Production Docker images use distroless base images:

- No shell (`/bin/sh`, `/bin/bash`)
- No package manager
- No unnecessary system utilities
- Minimal attack surface: only the compiled Rust binary and its runtime dependencies

## 5. Audit Trail

### 5.1 What Is Logged

Every security-relevant action generates an audit entry:

| Category         | Actions Logged                                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authentication   | Login success, login failure, registration, token refresh  |
| API Keys         | Creation, revocation, usage (rate limit hits)              |
| Providers        | Create, update, delete                                     |
| MCP Servers      | Create, delete, tool discovery                             |
| Users            | Create, role change, delete                                |
| Settings         | Any configuration change                                   |

### 5.2 Audit Entry Schema

Each audit log entry contains:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-28T09:15:00.000Z",
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "user_email": "admin@example.com",
  "action": "provider.create",
  "resource_type": "provider",
  "resource_id": "uuid",
  "details": {},
  "ip_address": "10.0.1.50",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0..."
}
```

### 5.3 ClickHouse Integration

Audit entries are inserted into ClickHouse for SQL-based search and analytics:

- Database: Configurable via `CLICKHOUSE_DB` (default: `think_watch`)
- Entries are sent asynchronously to avoid blocking request processing.
- The console provides a search UI at `/api/audit/logs` with support for time-range filtering and SQL queries.

### 5.4 Log Forwarder / SIEM Integration

For enterprise environments, ThinkWatch can forward audit logs to external systems via the admin Web UI (Admin > Log Forwarders):

- **Supported transports:** UDP Syslog, TCP Syslog (RFC 5424), Kafka, HTTP Webhook
- **Configuration:** Managed dynamically through the database — no restart required
- **Format:** RFC 5424 structured data for syslog transports:

```
<14>1 2026-03-28T09:15:00.000Z thinkwatch - - - [thinkwatch@0 action="provider.create" user="admin@example.com" resource_type="provider" resource_id="uuid"] Provider created: openai-prod
```

This allows integration with SIEM platforms such as Splunk, Elastic SIEM, Microsoft Sentinel, and others.

---

## 6. Startup Validation

ThinkWatch validates all secrets and dependencies before starting the server. If any critical requirement is not met, the process exits with a clear error message rather than running in a degraded state.

Validated at startup:
- `JWT_SECRET` is present, at least 32 characters, and passes an entropy check
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is present and a valid 64-character hex string
- PostgreSQL is reachable and responds to a test query
- Redis is reachable and responds to a PING
- OIDC variables are either all set or all absent (partial configuration is rejected)
- ClickHouse connectivity (if configured; logs a warning but does not block startup)

---

## 7. Setup Endpoint Security

The `POST /api/setup/initialize` endpoint allows creating the first admin user without authentication. To prevent abuse:

- **Rate limiting:** The endpoint is limited to 5 requests per minute per IP address.
- **Double-check:** Before creating the admin user, the endpoint performs a database query to verify no admin user exists. This prevents race conditions where two concurrent requests could both create admin accounts.
- **Disabled after use:** Once the system is initialized, the endpoint returns `400 Bad Request` for all subsequent calls, regardless of rate limit status.

---

## 8. Soft-Delete and Data Retention

ThinkWatch uses soft-delete for critical resources:

| Resource     | Behavior                                                                          |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Users        | `deleted_at` is set; all sessions are revoked; the user cannot log in             |
| Providers    | `deleted_at` is set; the provider's models become unavailable for new requests    |
| API Keys     | `deleted_at` is set; the key is immediately rejected by the auth middleware       |

**Data retention policy:**
- Soft-deleted records are retained for a configurable period (default: 30 days, controlled by the `data_retention_days` setting).
- A background task periodically purges records older than the retention period.
- Account deletion via the API is always a soft-delete operation: the user's sessions are revoked, and `deleted_at` is marked. The record is permanently removed only after the retention period expires.

## 9. Hardening Checklist

Use this checklist when preparing ThinkWatch for production deployment.

### Secrets and Cryptography

- [ ] Set `JWT_SECRET` to a cryptographically random value (minimum 32 characters, recommended 64 hex characters / 256 bits):
  ```bash
  openssl rand -hex 32
  ```
- [ ] Set `ENCRYPTION_KEY` to a random 32-byte hex string:
  ```bash
  openssl rand -hex 32
  ```
- [ ] Rotate `JWT_SECRET` periodically (note: rotation invalidates all active tokens)
- [ ] Store all secrets in a proper secrets manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, K8s Secrets) rather than plaintext `.env` files
- [ ] Verify startup validation passes without warnings (check logs for entropy check results)

### Network

- [ ] Set `CORS_ORIGINS` to your actual console domain (e.g. `https://console.example.com`)
- [ ] Deploy the console (port 3001) behind a VPN or corporate firewall; do not expose it to the public internet
- [ ] Enable TLS termination on the reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, Traefik, or cloud LB)
- [ ] Configure HSTS headers on the reverse proxy
- [ ] Restrict gateway (port 3000) access to known CIDR ranges if possible

### Authentication

- [ ] Configure OIDC for SSO with your corporate identity provider
- [ ] Disable password-based registration in production (use admin-provisioned accounts or SSO)
- [ ] Enforce strong password policies if password auth is enabled
- [ ] Set up rate limiting on login endpoints to mitigate brute-force attacks

### Database and Infrastructure

- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL to require TLS (`sslmode=require` in `DATABASE_URL`)
- [ ] Enable Redis authentication (`requirepass` directive)
- [ ] Use Redis TLS if available (`rediss://` scheme)
- [ ] Restrict PostgreSQL access to only the ThinkWatch service account
- [ ] Run database migrations only from a privileged CI/CD pipeline, not from the application at runtime

### API Key Lifecycle

- [ ] Set appropriate `inactivity_timeout_days` on API keys to auto-disable unused keys
- [ ] Establish a key rotation schedule and use `POST /api/keys/{id}/rotate` for zero-downtime rotation
- [ ] Periodically review expiring keys via `GET /api/keys/expiring?days=30`
- [ ] Configure `data_retention_days` to comply with your data retention policy

### Audit and Monitoring

- [ ] Set up log rotation for application logs
- [ ] Verify ClickHouse audit tables are being populated
- [ ] Configure log forwarders to your SIEM via Admin > Log Forwarders if applicable
- [ ] Set up alerts for `auth.login_failed` spikes (potential brute-force)
- [ ] Monitor the `/api/health`, `/health/live`, and `/health/ready` endpoints with your infrastructure monitoring system
- [ ] Configure Prometheus scraping of the `/metrics` endpoint (gateway port 3000)
- [ ] Set up alerts for API key inactivity and expiration events

### Container and Runtime

- [ ] Use the distroless production image (no shell, no package manager)
- [ ] Run the container as a non-root user
- [ ] Set read-only filesystem where possible
- [ ] Apply resource limits (CPU, memory) to prevent runaway processes
- [ ] Scan container images for CVEs in CI/CD

### RBAC

- [ ] Review all user roles and ensure least-privilege assignment
- [ ] Audit admin accounts regularly
- [ ] Use `service` role for machine-to-machine integrations
- [ ] Restrict `allowed_models` on API keys to only the models each consumer needs
