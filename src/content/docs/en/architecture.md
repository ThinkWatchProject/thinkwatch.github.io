# ThinkWatch Architecture

## 1. Overview

ThinkWatch is an enterprise AI API gateway and MCP (Model Context Protocol) management platform built in Rust. It acts as a **secure gateway** for all AI access within an organization -- every request from developer tools, automated agents, and internal applications flows through a single controlled gateway before reaching upstream AI providers or MCP servers.

This architecture provides centralized:

- **Authentication and authorization** -- API key validation, JWT-based sessions, OIDC SSO, and role-based access control.
- **Cost management** -- per-key and per-team budgets, token-level usage tracking, and real-time cost calculation.
- **Rate limiting** -- requests-per-minute (RPM) and tokens-per-minute (TPM) enforcement per API key.
- **Audit logging** -- every request is recorded with full context for compliance and debugging.
- **Model access governance** -- fine-grained permissions controlling which users, teams, and roles can access which AI models and MCP tools.
- **Multi-provider abstraction** -- a unified API (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Responses formats) that proxies to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, and custom providers with automatic request/response format translation.

## 3. Dual-Port Architecture

ThinkWatch binds two separate TCP listeners on a single process:

| Port | Name    | Purpose                                   | Audience           |
|------|---------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| 3000 | Gateway | AI API proxy (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/models`), MCP proxy (`/mcp`), health checks (`/health/live`, `/health/ready`), Prometheus metrics (`/metrics`) | AI clients, agents, monitoring |
| 3001 | Console | Management REST API (`/api/*`), Web UI    | Administrators     |

### Why Two Ports?

**Security isolation.** The gateway port is the only port that should be exposed to the public network or developer workstations. It accepts API key authentication and serves the high-throughput proxy path. The console port serves the administrative interface and should be restricted to an internal network, VPN, or localhost.

**Network topology recommendations:**

- **Production:** Place a reverse proxy (nginx, traefik, or a cloud load balancer) in front of both ports. Expose only port 3000 to the public or developer network. Restrict port 3001 to an internal network segment or require VPN access.
- **Kubernetes:** Create two separate Ingress resources -- a public Ingress for the gateway host and an internal Ingress (or no Ingress at all, using port-forward) for the console host.
- **Development:** Both ports are accessible on localhost. The React dev server (pnpm dev) proxies API calls to `localhost:3001`.

## 4. AI API Gateway Data Flow

When a client sends a request through the gateway (via `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages`, or `/v1/responses`), the following steps occur:

```
Client                Gateway :3000                        Upstream Provider
  |                        |                                      |
  |  POST /v1/chat/completions                                    |
  |  Authorization: Bearer tw-xxxx                                |
  |----------------------->|                                      |
  |                        |                                      |
  |               1. API Key Auth Middleware                       |
  |                  - Extract key prefix (tw-xxxx)               |
  |                  - Hash key, lookup in PostgreSQL              |
  |                  - Validate: active, not expired, budget ok    |
  |                  - Attach user_id, team_id, scopes to request |
  |                        |                                      |
  |               2. Model Router                                 |
  |                  - Extract model from request body             |
  |                  - Find provider + model in registry           |
  |                  - Check model_permissions for user/team/role  |
  |                  - Check allowed_models on the API key         |
  |                        |                                      |
  |               3. Request Transform                            |
  |                  - If provider is Anthropic: -> Claude format  |
  |                  - If provider is Google: -> Gemini format     |
  |                  - If provider is Azure: -> Azure OpenAI format|
  |                  - If provider is Bedrock: -> Converse API     |
  |                  - If provider is OpenAI: pass through         |
  |                        |                                      |
  |               4. Rate Limiter                                 |
  |                  - Check RPM counter in Redis                  |
  |                  - Estimate tokens, check TPM counter          |
  |                  - If exceeded: return 429 Too Many Requests   |
  |                        |                                      |
  |               5. Upstream Proxy                                |
  |                  - Build request with provider API key         |
  |                    (decrypted from providers.api_key_encrypted)|
  |                  - Forward to provider base_url                |
  |                        |--- POST provider.base_url ---------->|
  |                        |                                      |
  |                        |<--- SSE stream / JSON response ------|
  |                        |                                      |
  |               6. Response Transform                           |
  |                  - Convert upstream response to client format  |
  |                  - Bedrock: decode binary event-stream         |
  |                  - Stream SSE chunks back to client            |
  |                        |                                      |
  |<-- SSE stream ---------|                                      |
  |                        |                                      |
  |               7. Async Post-Processing (spawned task)         |
  |                  - Count input/output tokens (tiktoken)        |
  |                  - Calculate cost from model pricing           |
  |                  - Insert usage_record into PostgreSQL         |
  |                  - Push audit log to ClickHouse                |
  |                  - Forward to log forwarders (syslog/kafka/webhook) |
  |                  - Update rate limit counters in Redis         |
  |                        |                                      |
  |               8. Access logging                                |
  |                  - method, path, status, latency, and client  |
  |                    IP recorded to ClickHouse asynchronously    |
```

### Key Design Decisions

- **Streaming-first:** The proxy uses `eventsource-stream` and `async-stream` to forward SSE chunks in real time with minimal buffering. For AWS Bedrock, native binary event-stream decoding is used. Token counting happens after the stream completes.
- **Provider API keys are encrypted at rest** using AES-256-GCM. The `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable provides the 256-bit key. For AWS Bedrock, credentials (`ACCESS_KEY_ID:SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) are encrypted with the same scheme and used for SigV4 request signing via the official `aws-sigv4` crate.
- **Multi-format support:** The gateway accepts three API formats: OpenAI Chat Completions (`/v1/chat/completions`), Anthropic Messages (`/v1/messages`), and OpenAI Responses (`/v1/responses`). Regardless of the inbound format, the request is routed through the same model router and translated to the upstream provider's native format. This means a single `tw-` API key can be used with any client tool.

## 5. MCP Gateway Data Flow

The MCP gateway allows clients (such as Claude Code or Cursor) to access remote MCP tool servers through a single authenticated endpoint:

```
MCP Client              MCP Gateway :3000/mcp            Upstream MCP Server
  |                           |                                  |
  |  POST /mcp                |                                  |
  |  Authorization: Bearer <JWT>                                 |
  |  (or tw-xxx API key)      |                                  |
  |-------------------------->|                                  |
  |                           |                                  |
  |               1. Authentication                              |
  |                  - Validate JWT or API key                   |
  |                  - Extract user identity + roles             |
  |                           |                                  |
  |               2. Session Management                          |
  |                  - Mcp-Session-Id header check               |
  |                  - Create new session or resume existing     |
  |                  - Session state stored in Redis             |
  |                           |                                  |
  |               3. JSON-RPC Dispatch                           |
  |                  Parse method:                               |
  |                  - "initialize" -> return capabilities       |
  |                  - "tools/list" -> aggregate from registry   |
  |                  - "tools/call" -> route to server           |
  |                           |                                  |
  |               4. Tool Namespace Resolution (tools/call)      |
  |                  - Tool name: "github__create_issue"         |
  |                  - Split on "__" -> server="github",         |
  |                    tool="create_issue"                       |
  |                  - Look up server in mcp_servers registry    |
  |                           |                                  |
  |               5. Access Control Check                        |
  |                  - Check mcp_tool_permissions for            |
  |                    user/team/role against this tool           |
  |                  - Deny if not permitted                     |
  |                           |                                  |
  |               6. Connection Pool -> Upstream                 |
  |                  - Get/create connection from pool            |
  |                  - Forward JSON-RPC call to upstream server   |
  |                           |--- POST server.endpoint_url ---->|
  |                           |<-- JSON-RPC response ------------|
  |                           |                                  |
  |               7. Response Forwarding + Audit                 |
  |                  - Return JSON-RPC response to client        |
  |                  - Log tool invocation to audit_logs         |
  |                           |                                  |
  |<-- JSON-RPC response -----|                                  |
```

### Key Design Decisions

- **Streamable HTTP transport** is the primary MCP transport. The gateway connects to upstream servers via `streamable_http`.
- **Tool aggregation:** When a client calls `tools/list`, the gateway aggregates tools from all registered MCP servers that the user has access to, prefixing each tool name with its server name and `__` to avoid collisions.
- **Connection pooling** reuses upstream MCP connections to avoid repeated handshakes.
- **Health checking** runs periodically (configurable via `health_check_interval`) to mark servers as healthy or unhealthy.

## 6. Crate Architecture

ThinkWatch is structured as a Cargo workspace with five crates:

```
crates/
  server/           # Binary crate -- HTTP servers, routes, handlers, middleware
  gateway/          # Library -- AI API proxy engine
  mcp-gateway/      # Library -- MCP proxy engine
  auth/             # Library -- authentication and authorization
  common/           # Library -- shared infrastructure
```

### server

The application entry point. Contains:

- **`main.rs`** -- Initializes config, database, Redis, runs startup validation (dependency checks, JWT secret entropy), and starts both the gateway and console Axum servers.
- **`app.rs`** -- Builds the Axum router trees for both ports.
- **`background_tasks/`** -- Periodic background jobs:
  - `api_key_lifecycle.rs` -- Runs hourly to enforce key rotation periods, inactivity timeouts, and expiry policies.
  - `data_retention.rs` -- Runs daily to purge expired usage records, audit logs, and soft-deleted records past the 30-day retention window.
- **`handlers/`** -- Request handlers organized by domain:
  - `auth.rs`, `sso.rs` -- Login, registration, OIDC callbacks
  - `api_keys.rs` -- CRUD for virtual API keys
  - `providers.rs` -- AI provider and model management
  - `mcp_servers.rs`, `mcp_tools.rs` -- MCP server registry management
  - `analytics.rs`, `audit.rs` -- Usage dashboards, audit log queries

## 7. Log Exploration Architecture

### Log Storage Architecture

ThinkWatch stores six types of logs in ClickHouse, each in a dedicated table:

| Table | Purpose | TTL |
|-------|---------|-----|
| `audit_logs` | Security audit trail (login, API key ops, settings changes) | 90 days |
| `gateway_logs` | AI API request logs (model, tokens, cost, latency) | 90 days |
| `mcp_logs` | MCP tool invocation logs (server, tool, duration, status) | 90 days |
| `platform_logs` | Platform management operations | 90 days |
| `access_logs` | HTTP access logs for both ports (method, path, status, latency) | 30 days |
| `app_logs` | Application runtime tracing (level, target, message, spans) | 30 days |

All tables use MergeTree engine with monthly partitioning and TTL-based automatic cleanup. HTTP access logs and application traces are written asynchronously to avoid blocking request processing.

All log types are queryable from a single **Log Explorer** page in the admin console with structured query syntax.

## 9. Frontend Architecture

The web console is a single-page application located in the `web/` directory.

### Technology Stack

- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **shadcn/ui** component library (Tailwind CSS-based)
- **Simple pushState routing** (no external router library)
- **Fetch API** for all HTTP requests, with JWT from `localStorage`

### Page Structure

The UI consists of approximately 20 pages organized into six groups:

| Group       | Pages                             | Description |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| Setup       | `setup.tsx`                       | First-run setup wizard (super_admin creation, site config, optional provider setup) |
| Auth        | `login.tsx`                       | Login form (local + OIDC SSO) |
| Dashboard   | `dashboard.tsx`                   | Overview: usage charts, cost summary, recent activity |
| Gateway     | `providers.tsx`, `models.tsx`, `api-keys.tsx`, `logs.tsx` | AI provider management, model registry, API key CRUD, request logs |
| MCP         | `servers.tsx`, `tools.tsx`, `logs.tsx` | MCP server registry, tool discovery/permissions, MCP request logs |
| Analytics   | `usage.tsx`, `costs.tsx`, `audit.tsx` | Token usage dashboards, cost breakdowns, audit log search |
| Admin       | `users.tsx`, `roles.tsx`, `settings.tsx` | User management, RBAC role configuration, system settings |

### API Client Pattern

All pages communicate with the console server (`/api/*`) using a shared fetch wrapper that:

1. Reads the JWT from `localStorage`.
2. Attaches it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
3. Handles 401 responses by redirecting to the login page.
4. Parses JSON responses and surfaces errors to the UI.

The web UI is built as a static SPA and served either by the development server (Vite with `pnpm dev`) or by an nginx container in production (see `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.web` and `deploy/docker/nginx.conf`).
